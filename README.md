User Input:

First, the program asks you to choose an operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) by typing a number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
Then, it asks for two numbers to perform the operation.
If-Else Logic:

If you enter "1", the program adds the two numbers.
If you enter "2", it subtracts the second number from the first.
If you enter "3", it multiplies the numbers.
If you enter "4", it divides the numbers, but it first checks if you're dividing by zero (which is not allowed).
If you type something other than "1", "2", "3", or "4", it tells you that the input is invalid.
Example:
The program asks: "Select operation:"
You type "1" for adding.
Then it asks: "Enter the first number: "
You type "5".
Then it asks: "Enter the second number: "
You type "3".
The result is shown: "The result of adding 5.0 and 3.0 is: 8.0".
